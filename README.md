# Maximal Correlation Regression (MCR) on MNIST 

This repository contains simple [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementations of [Maximal Correlation Regression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8979352) (MCR), on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. 


## Maximal Correlation Regression
[Maximal Correlation Regression [1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8979352) (MCR) is a regression analysis approach based on Hirschfeld-Gebelein-RÃ©nyi (HGR) maximal correlation. The basic idea is to represent the dependency between data variable $X$ and label $Y$ by their maximally correlated features $f^\ast(X)$ and $g^\ast(Y)$.



## Implementation
The implementation is based on the maximizing of H-score of features f and g[^1][^2]:

$$H(f, g) = \mathbb{E}[f^T(X)g(Y)] - \mathbb{E}[f^T(X)]\mathbb{E}[g(Y)] - \frac12 \mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbb{E}[f(X) f^T(X)]\mathbb{E}[g(Y)g^T(Y)]\right)$$

[^1]: The implementation in the repo uses an H-score on zero-mean features.
[^2]: A more advanced version, which learns structured features, can be found [here](https://github.com/XiangxiangXu/h-nest).

The network architecture is as follows [1, Figure 6]:

The feature extractor $\mathtt{NN}_f$ is a simple CNN [1, Figure 2], and by default, the output feature dimension is $k = 128$:

We can also compare the performance of MCR with the baseline method trained on **S**oftmax classifier with **L**og loss (SL). When trained on 1,000 samples and set feature dimension $k = 10$, the extracted features for two methods can be visualized by T-SNE [2] as (left: MCR, right: SL)
